# Word-by-Word


## Vision
Despite voluminous research showing that basic skills remediation can make the difference between a student being college-bound or a high school drop-put, there is no coherent, ready-to-use, age-appropiate tool available to educators looking to improve the foundational language skills of their struggling students.

Current grammar apps only target elementary students with cartoon-based instruction and tend to focus on the nit-picky rules of the English language rather than fundamental skills like sentence structure and clauses.

Word-by-word aims to fill the void with a robust, self-differentiating set of instructional games that provide instant feedback to the student and detailed performance data to the instructor.
