# Word-by-Word


## Vision 
Word-by-word is a educational Rails web app built to help students acquire foundational language skills.

In this early stage, we are developing basic subject-verb-object identification, as well a robust data-tracking platform, all built on a ReactJS font-end and a Rails backend. 

Early units use a simple drag-and-drop interface made snappy by ReactJS ternarys utilizing asynchronous fetch calls to make for a seamless user experience. 

## Updates
* Word-by-word is undergoing extensive remodeling-
* Styling is still inconsistent, but expect frequent changes.
